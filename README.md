#Introduction

**You need to have basic understanding of the C programming language to proceed with the codes from this repository.**

###Primitive types and built-in data structures in C
C is a statically typed language. Each of the variables should be type casted.
There are five basic data types associated with variables:
- int - integer: a whole number.
- float - floating point value: i.e. a number with a fractional part.
- double - a double-precision floating point value.
- char - a single character.
- void - valueless special purpose type.

Other than these there are some derived data types. they are -
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Structures
- Enumeration

###How to Use
To test or use codes from this repository you can use any popular IDE, online Editor or compile them locally using GCC compiler.
Following links will help on how to compile a C code in linux.

######TL;DR
Run following command to compile a C code (You need to have [gcc compiler](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingCompilers) installed):

`gcc file_name.c -o file_name`

you will get an executable named: `file-name`

run it using:

`./file_name`
